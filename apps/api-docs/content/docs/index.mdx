# Introduction

**Dora** is a modern, lightweight, and blazing fast SQL client built with Tauri and Next.js.
It supports Postgres, SQLite, and LibSQL (Turso) out of the box.

## Architecture

Dora is built on a split architecture:

- **Frontend**: A Next.js application handling the UI, state, and visualization.
- **Backend**: A Rust (Tauri) process handling database connections, query execution, and secure storage.

Communication happens exclusively via the [Tauri Command API](./api).

## Features

- **Multi-Database Support**: Connect to Postgres, SQLite, and LibSQL.
- **Visual Query Builder**: (Coming soon)
- **Safe Mode**: Dangerous operations like `DROP TABLE` require explicit confirmation.
- **Themeable**: Customizable UI with color accents per connection.
